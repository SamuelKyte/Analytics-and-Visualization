'''My definitions have been taken from the info provided in the task's pdf file.


1. Define each of the following terms:
a) Data: Data are raw bits of information (ex. telephone numbers, names or birth dates). Unless interpreted and organized, data is more or less meaningless.

b) Field: A field is used to define data and store it. A field is expressed as a character or group of characters that have a specific meaning.

c) Record: A record is a logically connected set of one or more fields that describes a person, place or thing.

d) File: A file is a collection of related records.


2. What is a DBMS and what are its advantages?
(Information found at: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-of-database-management-system/)
DBMS - Database Management System
Advantages: 
Better Data Transferring: Database management creates a place where users have an advantage of more and better-managed data. Thus making it possible for end-users to have a quick look and to respond fast to any changes made in their environment.

Better Data Security: The more accessible and usable the database, the more it is prone to security issues. As the number of users increases, the data transferring or data sharing rate also increases thus increasing the risk of data security. It is widely used in the corporate world where companies invest money, time, and effort in large amounts to ensure data is secure and is used properly. A Database Management System (DBMS) provides a better platform for data privacy and security policies thus, helping companies to improve Data Security.

Better data integration: Due to the Database Management System we have an access to well managed and synchronized form of data thus it makes data handling very easy and gives an integrated view of how a particular organization is working and also helps to keep a track of how one segment of the company affects another segment.

Minimized Data Inconsistency: Data inconsistency occurs between files when different versions of the same data appear in different places. For Example, data inconsistency occurs when a student’s name is saved as “John Wayne” on a main computer of the school but on the teacher registered system same student name is “William J. Wayne”, or when the price of a product is $86.95 in the local system of the company and its National sales office system shows the same product price as $84.95. So if a database is properly designed then Data inconsistency can be greatly reduced hence minimizing data inconsistency.

Faster data Access: The Database management system (DBMS) helps to produce quick answers to database queries thus making data access faster and more accurate. For example, to read or update the data. For example, end-users, when dealing with large amounts of sale data, will have enhanced access to the data, enabling a faster sales cycle. Some queries may be like:
What is the increase in sales in the last three months?
What is the bonus given to each of the salespeople in the last five months?
How many customers have a credit score of 850 or more?

Better decision making: Due to DBMS now we have Better managed data and Improved data access because of which we can generate better quality information hence on this basis better decisions can be made. Better Data quality improves accuracy, validity, and time it takes to read data. DBMS does not guarantee data quality, it provides a framework to make it easy to improve data quality.

Increased end-user productivity: The data which is available with the help of a combination of tools that transform data into useful information, helps end-users to make quick, informative, and better decisions that can make difference between success and failure in the global economy.

Simple: Database management system (DBMS) gives a simple and clear logical view of data. Many operations like insertion, deletion, or creation of files or data are easy to implement.

Data abstraction: The major purpose of a database system is to provide users with an abstract view of the data. Since many complex algorithms are used by the developers to increase the efficiency of databases that are being hidden by the users through various data abstraction levels to allow users to easily interact with the system.

Reduction in data Redundancy: When working with a structured database, DBMS provides the feature to prevent the input of duplicate items in the database. for e.g. – If there are two same students in different rows, then one of the duplicate data will be deleted.

3. Explain the difference between data and information.

4. What is metadata?
(Info found at: https://www.opendatasoft.com/en/blog/what-is-metadata-and-why-is-it-important-data)
Metadata is a shorthand representation of the data to which they refer. We can think of metadata as references to data.

5. Given the file below, answer the following questions:

e) How many records does the file contain?
   There are 3 records in this file.

f) How many fields are there per record?
   There are 6 fields in this file.
