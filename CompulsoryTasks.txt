Compulsory Task 1:
==================
Visualizations not found in task breif:
=======================================
(got help here: https://boostlabs.com/blog/10-types-of-data-visualization-tools/)

1. Bubble chart: presents relationships and/or distributions. Like a scatter chart, a bubble chart does not use a category axis. Instead, it is plotted with the data sets as X-values, Y-values and Z-values (as bubbles).

2. Bullet graph: helps visually track progress. Uses a single main measure, and then compares that measure to other measures to discover and analyze  deeper meaning and connections.  

3. Marimekko chart (Mekko chart): similar layout to a stacked bar graph. Except, instead of tracking time progression, the X-axis measures another dimension of your data sets. 

Allows comparison of values, measurements of the composition of each value, and analysis of data distribution all at the same time. 



Compulsory Task 2:
==================
Visualisation A
================
■  Add lines to connect titles to chart: This could make it clearer to show which section each title pertains to.


■ Add values to the sections. I can currently see roughly which values are smaller or larger, but the values would be helpful to the reader.


■ Add thicker borders to the sections to seperate sections. If this were printed in B&W the colors would not be clear, so creating a border to the sections would help keep the data clear.


Visualisation B
===============
■ Increase font size to help readability.


■ add values at the top of the columns to better present data


■ Retitle. Bagels sold per day or Daily Bagel Sales would be a better descriptor.



Visualisation C
===============
■ X-axis title should be on the bottom (Months)


■ 6 months sale should be centered and could be rewritten as Sales in 1st and 2nd Quarters or something more descriptive.


■ Legend should have better labels; no underscores, should be capitalized, etc.
